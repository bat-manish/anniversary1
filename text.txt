It’s been an year since you came into my life.

From that day on my life has been like a movie I felt feeling that I never thought I could ever feel. Love, you converted a rick and morty fan into a literal cringe lord. I love being cringe lord by the way. I have said this before but tu sahi mein meri Jaan hai. My subconscious wakes me up around 9:30 just to wish you good morning and check on you. I literally search for my phone like a pyaasa searches for paani. Papa chipa dete hain phone sometimes. When I listen to the clink notifications I become so happy Jaan aa gayi. Ek baar kisi me phone mein baza bhai mai khush ho Gaya only to realise damn not mine. And that tiny nose of yours yum yum Kha lunga. Is baar kite date pe mile hain fhir Bhi man aur Milna chahta hai. You are literally the best person to be with. Tu rehti hai Mujhe Dimag chalane ki zaroorat nai padti just love the feeling of being with you. But time is so cruel....when I am with you it runs so fast hours end like they are minutes and days like hours.
